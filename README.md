# crack_detection
This project is mainly based on computer vision technology to propose a system for a series of operations from detection, localization, and assessment of building damage. Building images are collected by drone, damage areas are extracted by semantic segmentation algorithm, and the actual damage degree is calculated by camera calibration and skeleton extraction, and damage assessment is carried out based on this.

1. Using Pytorch as the deep learning framework, a defect detection algorithm based on image classification and semantic segmentation is constructed to realize the localization and detection of concrete defects;
2. Build a building damage detection system based on Qt architecture, complete the skeleton extraction algorithm based on Opencv, and calculate the damage of actual buildings.
